According to Homesfirst organization (2022) around 8,500 people in Toronto are experiencing homelessness on any given day. Through ABDT we would like to raise awareness to the homelessness situation in Canada, and provide resources to those in that situation. We plan to achieve this by collaborating with non-profit organizations such as Youth Without Shelter, Toronto Alliance to End Homelessness (TAEH), Salvation Army, and local shelters. We will be arranging seminars and tabling events to raise awareness about this situation. Furthermore, we plan to take mini field trips to areas experiencing high rates of homelessness such as areas in downtown Toronto. In these mini field trips, we will meet with shelters around the GTA and drop off little care packages with goods and hygiene products. As well, this will allow group members to speak directly to shelter staff, and different organizations to increase awareness about this situation.",

The group focuses on ways to build black excellence on campus while also delivering fun activity nights to destress from the responsibilities of being a student. This organization is to provide a safe environment to encourage the lifestyle of African students and the diaspora to the University of Toronto Mississauga Campus. The University of Toronto Mississauga African Students Association aims to provide this accepting space by organizing events that cater to the diverse experiences of the students, as well as allow them to form relationship and participate in diverse events on campus.",
